            All the pitchers have their maximum pitching velocity record. The maximum velocity using here means the
            pitcher has the ability to cost more effort and strength on a single power pitch. And it indicates that the
            pitchers are not likely to pitch like that for every pitch, it is related to the pitcherâ€™s energy, stamina,
            etc. Especially for starter pitchers, they are responsible for pitching at least 5 innings or around 100
            pitches in a game. They would like to reasonably save energy and strength to promise a stable pitching
            performance through several innings but not all-in for every pitch. So, we are curious that when is the
            specific condition that a starter pitcher would like to give a power pitch? Is it the moment that their
            opponents get the chance to score or the moment they are facing an extraordinary batter?
